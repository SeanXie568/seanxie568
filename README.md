# 👋 Hi, I'm Sean Xie.

I'm building AI-powered native iOS experiences — combining SwiftUI, local LLMs, and modern UI/UX to explore what's possible on-device.

---

## 🧠 Currently Building

**Swift LLM Chat App** — A native iOS chat interface with:

- 💬 Multi-turn chat UI (user + bot)
- 📂 Support for `.gguf` LLMs (Gemma, Qwen, etc.)
- 🛠️ Written in **SwiftUI** + `LLM.swift`

> This project is a playground for experimenting with AI-first mobile design — where models run **locally**, and the UI feels smooth and native.

## 🧪 Goals

- Build practical tools powered by local models
- Explore design patterns for AI-native mobile apps
- Ship real experiences, not just demos
